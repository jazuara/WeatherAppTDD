# WeatherAppTDD

Sample app to demonstrate test-driven development, object oriented design, and the iOS platform. 
The code is written Objective-C.

Requirements:

The app should allow the user to choose a city and state and view the weather forecast (10 days). 
The forecast for each day should display the high temp, low temp, and textual description.

Im using Yahoo free weather service.
